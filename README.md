#Proposal: Hybrid AI Framework Utilizing SLM to Augment LLM in End User Computing
##1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a pivotal element in end user computing, offering advanced capabilities and automation. However, the resource demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) often exceed the capacity of typical end user devices, such as personal computers and mobile devices. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a more feasible alternative, but they lack the performance and capabilities of their larger counterparts. This proposal presents a hybrid AI framework where SLMs (running locally) co-work with LLMs (accessed via inference APIs or vendor servers) to overcome these limitations.

##2. Background
###2.1 Challenges in End User Computing with AI

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into end user computing presents several challenges:

1. **Resource Limitations of End User Devices**: Personal computers and mobile devices often lack the necessary computational power and memory to efficiently run Large Language Models (LLMs). This limitation hampers the ability to leverage advanced AI capabilities directly on these devices.

2. **High Computational and Memory Requirements of LLMs**: LLMs, such as GPT-3 and Llama 3, require significant computational resources and memory. These demands are beyond the capacity of typical end user devices, making it difficult to utilize these models without relying on cloud-based solutions.

3. **Latency and Performance Issues**: Utilizing cloud-based AI services introduces latency, which can affect the performance and user experience. Real-time applications, such as conversational AI and real-time text processing, require low latency to function effectively, which is challenging when relying on remote servers.

###2.2 Current Solutions and Limitations

To address the challenges of integrating AI into end user computing, several solutions have been proposed:

1. **Cloud-Based AI Services**: These services offload the computational burden to remote servers, allowing end users to access advanced AI capabilities without needing powerful hardware. However, this approach introduces latency and requires a stable internet connection.

2. **On-Device AI Models**: Smaller, optimized models can run directly on end user devices, providing AI capabilities without relying on cloud services. While this approach reduces latency, these models often lack the performance and capabilities of larger models.

3. **Trade-Offs Between Performance and Feasibility**: Both cloud-based and on-device solutions involve trade-offs. Cloud-based solutions offer better performance but introduce latency and dependency on internet connectivity. On-device solutions offer lower latency but with reduced performance and capabilities.

##3. Proposed Hybrid AI Framework
###3.1 Overview

The proposed hybrid AI framework leverages the strengths of both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). By combining these two types of models, the framework aims to provide an efficient and effective solution for AI applications in end user computing.

In this framework, the local SLM handles less demanding tasks and pre-processing. This allows for quick responses and reduced latency for simpler tasks. For more complex tasks that require higher computational power and advanced capabilities, the LLM is accessed via an inference API or vendor server. This division of labor optimizes the performance and feasibility of AI applications on resource-constrained devices.

###3.2 Architecture

The architecture of the proposed hybrid AI framework consists of two main components:

1. **Local Device**: The local device runs the SLM (e.g., Microsoft Phi-3). This component is responsible for handling initial processing, pre-processing, and less demanding tasks. The local SLM ensures quick responses and low latency for these tasks.

2. **Cloud/Vendor Server**: The cloud or vendor server runs the LLM (e.g., Llama 3). This component is accessed via an inference API and handles more complex tasks that require significant computational resources and advanced capabilities.

**Communication**: The communication between the local SLM and the LLM is facilitated through API-based data exchange. This ensures seamless integration and efficient data processing. The API calls and data exchange formats are designed to minimize latency and maximize performance.

##4. Implementation Details
###4.1 Setting Up the Local SLM
####4.1.1 Installing and Configuring Microsoft Phi-3

To set up the local SLM, we will use Microsoft Phi-3, an open-source small language model available on Hugging Face. Follow these steps to install and configure Microsoft Phi-3:

1. **Install the Transformers Library**:
   ```sh
   pip install transformers
   ```

2. **Load the Model and Tokenizer**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct")
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct")

   # Sample usage
   input_text = "How can I help you today?"
   inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
   outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
   print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
   ```

This setup will allow you to run Microsoft Phi-3 locally, providing a foundation for handling less demanding tasks and pre-processing.

###4.2 Integrating with LLM
####4.2.1 Setting Up Llama 3 Inference API

To integrate the LLM, we will use Llama 3, an open-source large language model available on Hugging Face. Follow these steps to set up the Llama 3 inference API:

1. **Set Up API Access**:
   - Obtain an API key from Hugging Face.
   - Install the requests library if not already installed:
     ```sh
     pip install requests
     ```

2. **Define the API Call Function**:
   ```python
   import requests

   api_url = "https://api.huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"
   headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}

   def query_llm(prompt):
       response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json={"inputs": prompt})
       return response.json()

   # Sample usage
   response = query_llm("How can I help you today?")
   print(response)
   ```

This setup will allow you to access Llama 3 via its inference API, enabling you to handle more complex tasks that require higher computational power.

##4.3 Communication Between SLM and LLM
####4.3.1 API Calls

Communication between the SLM and LLM is facilitated through API calls. The local SLM processes initial input and pre-processes data before sending it to the LLM for further processing. The following steps outline how to manage API calls:

1. **Define API Endpoints and Payloads**:
   - Specify the API endpoint for the LLM inference.
   - Structure the payload to include necessary input data.

2. **Handle Authentication and Error Management**:
   - Include API keys or tokens for authentication.
   - Implement error handling to manage failed API calls and retries.

Example API call function:
```python
import requests

def call_llm_api(prompt):
    api_url = "https://api.huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json={"inputs": prompt})
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise Exception(f"API call failed with status code {response.status_code}")

# Sample usage
try:
    result = call_llm_api("Tell me a joke.")
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

####4.3.2 Data Exchange Formats

To ensure seamless communication between the SLM and LLM, standardized data exchange formats are used. JSON is commonly employed for structured data exchange due to its simplicity and compatibility.

1. **Use JSON for Data Exchange**:
   - Serialize input and output data in JSON format.
   - Ensure consistency in data structures to facilitate smooth processing.

2. **Example Data Exchange**:
   ```python
   import json

   # Example input data
   input_data = {"text": "How can I assist you today?"}
   input_json = json.dumps(input_data)

   # Sending data to LLM API
   response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=input_json)
   output_data = response.json()

   # Processing the output data
   print(output_data["generated_text"])
   ```

By following these guidelines, the framework ensures efficient and reliable communication between the SLM and LLM, enabling effective hybrid AI processing.

##5. Example Code
###5.1 Initializing the SLM (Microsoft Phi-3)

To initialize the Small Language Model (SLM) using Microsoft Phi-3, follow these steps:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct")

# Sample usage
input_text = "How can I help you today?"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```
This code initializes the Microsoft Phi-3 model and tokenizer, processes an input text, and generates a response.

###5.2 Setting Up LLM Inference (Llama 3)

To set up the inference for the Large Language Model (LLM) using Llama 3, follow these steps:

```python
import requests

api_url = "https://api.huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}

def query_llm(prompt):
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json={"inputs": prompt})
    return response.json()

# Sample usage
response = query_llm("How can I help you today?")
print(response)
```
This code defines a function to query the Llama 3 model via an API, sends a prompt, and prints the response.

###5.3 Hybrid Model Execution

The following example demonstrates how to use the SLM for initial processing and the LLM for handling complex tasks:

```python
# Example: Using SLM for initial processing and LLM for complex tasks
input_text = "Summarize the latest news for me."

# Local SLM processing
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
slm_output = model.generate(**inputs)
intermediate_result = tokenizer.decode(slm_output[0])

# LLM processing via API
final_result = query_llm(intermediate_result)
print(final_result)
```
In this example, the input text is first processed by the local SLM (Microsoft Phi-3). The intermediate result is then sent to the LLM (Llama 3) for further processing via an API call, and the final result is printed.

##6. Possible Use Cases in End User Computing
###6.1 Real-time Text Processing

Real-time text processing is a critical application in end user computing, particularly for chat applications, customer service bots, and real-time translation services. The hybrid AI framework can significantly enhance these applications by leveraging the strengths of both SLMs and LLMs.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced latency for initial text processing using local SLM.
- Enhanced response quality for complex queries using LLM via API.

**Example**:
In a customer service bot, the local SLM can handle common queries and initial processing, providing immediate responses. For more complex inquiries, the SLM can preprocess the query and send it to the LLM for a detailed response, ensuring both speed and accuracy.

###6.2 Conversational AI

Conversational AI applications, such as virtual assistants and interactive voice response (IVR) systems, benefit greatly from the hybrid AI framework. These applications require natural language understanding and generation, which can be efficiently managed by combining SLMs and LLMs.

**Benefits**:
- Improved user experience through quick responses for simple tasks handled by the local SLM.
- Deep, context-aware responses for complex interactions managed by the LLM.

**Example**:
A virtual assistant on a mobile device can use the local SLM to handle routine tasks like setting reminders or providing weather updates. For more intricate tasks, such as making travel arrangements or answering detailed questions, the assistant can rely on the LLM accessed via the cloud, ensuring comprehensive and accurate interactions.

###6.3 Data Summarization

Data summarization applications, such as news aggregation and report generation, require processing large volumes of text and extracting key information. The hybrid AI framework can streamline these processes by using SLMs for initial data parsing and LLMs for generating concise summaries.

**Benefits**:
- Efficient initial data parsing by the local SLM reduces the load on the LLM.
- High-quality, coherent summaries produced by the LLM enhance the usefulness of the summarized data.

**Example**:
A news aggregation app can use the local SLM to parse articles and extract key points. These points can then be sent to the LLM to generate comprehensive summaries, providing users with a quick overview of the latest news without needing to read entire articles.
